            <p>
                This is the begining of the journey for peace. Starting here I always wanted to bring together the people by helping them showcase their voice. 
                Many people are looking for outlets to hear them and to really pay attention to what they are feeling during this time. All I ask is that we take the time to grow and gather ourselves 
                in hope of bringing life and love to our surrounding communities. Thank you for strength during this time, and I pray we can endure more for the better of our future!
